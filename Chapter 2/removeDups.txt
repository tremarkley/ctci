Remove Dups! Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

One way I can think of is having an object that keeps track of what values you have already seen. Then when you are looping through the 
linked list if you come across one you have already seen then remove the node

const removeDups = (list) => {
  const valuesSeen = {};
  let currentNode = list.head.data;
  while (currentNode !== null) {
    if (!valuesSeen[currentNode.data]) {
      removeNode(currentNode);
    } else {
      valuesSeen[currentNode.data] = true;
    }
  } 
  return list;
}

const removeNode = (node) => {
  // look for previous 
  if (node.prev !== null) {
    node.prev.next = node.next;
  }
}
