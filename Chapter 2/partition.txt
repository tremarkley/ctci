Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, 
such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. 
If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below). 
The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
EXAMPLE
Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1[partition=5] Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

as we loop through the linked list we can check to see if the current value is less than ex 
if it is then it needs to be on the left side.

One way I can think of is that we could create second linked list. Then iterate through the original
if we see a value that is less than the partition then we push it onto the head, else we push it on to the 
tail.
