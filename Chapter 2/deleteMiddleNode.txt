Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle 
(i.e., any node but the  first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) 
of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
EXAMPLE
Input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f

We only have access to the node we want to delete and not the entire list.

const deleteMiddle = (node) => {
  if (node === null || node.next === null) {
    return false; //Error
  }
  let nextNode = node.next;
  node.data = nextNode.data;
  node.next = nextNode.next;
}
